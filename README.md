# DataCompFinal
The object of my project is to get gas prices from a map server and sort them to find the lowest one. You could input a zip code and it would go from there. This is done using some sort of POST request I think. If I am not able to figure out how to get it from Google maps or any alternatives I will simply make mock data and host it on a server on my own and get the data from there.

$ python -m pip install requests
$ python -m pip install beautifulsoup4
